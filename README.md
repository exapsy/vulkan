# Vulkan project

## What is this project

This is just for my own sake to learn more about:

- Graphics programming
- Game engines
- Low level Performance
- How to get as much juice as possible out of that bad boi :>

## WHY

Someone could definitely argue that

> Hey, this is graphics, are you even into graphics?
> Why are you studying something as complicated as Vulkan?

I like discovering how such interesting and yet super complicated concepts like how Game Engines or Graphics work.
They offer me knowledge about how our computers work under the hood.
Game/Graphic Engines try to take as much juice as possible out of every part of your system, because they're incredibely heavy.

- They try to exploit your RAM for loading many objects for fast access.
- Exploiting your CPU for transferring information and instructions to your GPU or doing calculations.
- Exploiting your GPU to render graphics, perform complex calculations like Machine Learning algorithms.
- Exploting your Storage for fast loading screens and loading objects.
- They use as fast algorithms and as suitable data structures as possible, as performance is very crucial to them.

So by educating myself in regards to that matter, I'm also becoming more self aware of performance problems that might occur on every other project I involve myself into.
I'm becoming better at code reviewing my and other people's code as I learn more about critical issues.

I'm also learning about what engineering decisions were being made to solve important problems, and what approaches were taken that I could inherit too as part of my own engineering mindset.

Vulkan just seemed the most low level approach, and the best path to learn as much as low level stuff as it goes. That's all.

**And most importantly, coz its fun. Don't judge me.**
